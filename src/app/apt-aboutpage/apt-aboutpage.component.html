        About us. The Queen of spices as the household name among the millions
        today, Mr. P.C.DURAISAMY, the Founder of the Company was a small time
        turmeric trader, from a village called Perundurai near Erode. He found
        SAKTHI TRADING COMPANY in 1975 and was doing Turmeric Trading for some
        time. Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was a small, family-run
        spice shop called "Apt Masala." The shop was renowned for its aromatic
        blends of spices that added a burst of flavor to every dish. The owner,
        Mr. Patel, was a jovial man with a twinkle in his eye and a secret
        recipe book passed down through generations. One sunny morning, as Mr.
        Patel was opening the shop, he noticed a peculiar sight. A little girl,
        no older than seven, stood outside the shop, her eyes fixed on the
        colorful array of spices displayed in the window. She wore tattered
        clothes and had a hungry look in her eyes. Concerned, Mr. Patel
        approached her and asked, "Are you hungry, little one?" The girl nodded
        timidly, her stomach growling. Without hesitation, Mr. Patel ushered her
        into the shop and prepared a simple meal using his finest spices. As the
        girl savored the delicious meal, her eyes lit up with joy. From that day
        on, the little girl, named Maya, became a regular visitor to Apt Masala.
        She would help out in the shop, grinding spices and learning the art of
        blending flavors from Mr. Patel.

        Apt Masala wasn't just a typical spice shop; it was a treasure trove of
        culinary delights. Situated in the heart of the city's bustling food
        market, the shop exuded an intoxicating aroma that lured in passersby
        with promises of gastronomic adventures. Mr. Patel, the genial
        proprietor, was more than just a spice merchant; he was a custodian of
        age-old family recipes and culinary traditions passed down through
        generations. His ancestors were renowned spice traders who traveled far
        and wide, collecting exotic spices from distant lands and blending them
        into masterful concoctions. The shop itself was a feast for the senses,
        with shelves stacked high with colorful jars of spices, each bearing a
        label adorned with intricate calligraphy. From fragrant cinnamon and
        fiery chili powder to earthy cumin and pungent turmeric, Apt Masala
        boasted an extensive collection that catered to every palate and
        culinary whim. But what truly set Apt Masala apart was its commitment to
        quality. Mr. Patel sourced only the finest ingredients, hand-selecting
        each spice for its freshness, potency, and flavor profile. He believed
        that the key to exceptional cuisine lay in the quality of the spices,
        and he spared no effort in ensuring that every blend that left his shop
        was nothing short of perfection. Customers flocked to Apt Masala not
        only for its superior spices but also for the personalized service and
        expert advice offered by Mr. Patel and his knowledgeable staff. Whether
        it was a novice home cook seeking guidance or a seasoned chef in search
        of inspiration, everyone was welcomed with open arms and treated like
        family. As the years passed, Apt Masala became more than just a place to
        buy spices; it became a culinary institution, a beacon of excellence in
        a world overrun by mass-produced mediocrity. And though Mr. Patel's
        spice blends gained fame far and wide, the heart and soul of Apt Masala
        remained firmly rooted in its humble beginnings, where passion,
        tradition, and a dash of magic blended seamlessly to create culinary
        wonders.
